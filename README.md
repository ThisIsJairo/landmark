This is the second project on the Udacity Deep Learning nanodegree.

Here, I built a convolutional neural network for landmark classification. 
This project used Pytorch to train a CNN from scratch, and also used VGG-16 for transfer learning. 
Moreover, I implemented a python function that receives an image as an argument and returns the 3 most likely landmarks as predicted by the CNN.
